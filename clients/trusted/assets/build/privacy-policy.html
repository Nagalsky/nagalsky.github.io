                <p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either
                    ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
                <p>How do I withdraw my consent?</p>

                <h4>Section 3 - Disclosure
                </h4>
                <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our

                </p>

                <h4>Section 4 - Payment</h4>
                <p>All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
                    Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                    Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our
                    Site and its service providers.</p>

                <h4>Section 5 - Third-party services</h4>
                <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your
                    information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
                <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
                    transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
                    required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
                <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the
                    manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
                <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are
                    located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a
                    transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information
                    may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its
                    facilities are located.</p>

                    it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. If you provide
                    us with your

                    stored with a
                    AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is
