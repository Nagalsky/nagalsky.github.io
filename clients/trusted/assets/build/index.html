          <h2 class="text-center m-0">5 reasons why Wi-Fi Xtraboost is our #1 pick</h2>
          <img src="img/temp/Main1.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 my-5">

          <h2>It has just the right amount of features</h2>
          <p class="mb-5">Our team had to go through a lot of boosters to select the most affordable and best ones. And
            while many
            gadgets seemed straight out of the sci-fi novel, we considered simplicity far more important. After all,
            when speed and reliability are the goals, no one wants to scramble with complicated controls. Wi-Fi <a
              href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> has anything anyone might want from such a
            device without being difficult to use at all. <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a>
            has a LAN port to connect your non-portable devices, a WPS function to ensure safe connectivity, universal
            compatibility (meaning it matches any device or router in the world), and no limit on the number of users.
            It can be placed in any part of your home and match any Internet Service Provider.</p>

          <h2>Its performance is impeccable</h2>
          <p>It doesn’t take long to set up your <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a>, and you can notice the
            results right away. As soon as the
            device gets plugged in, you’ll see your Wi-Fi speed improve significantly. More importantly, areas
            previously thought to be utterly devoid of connection can now offer internet access without any trouble.
            We attempted several tests to see how well Wi-Fi <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> works in
            different situations, and here’s what
            we found out.</p>

          <img src="img/temp/Main2.png" alt="" class="w-100 my-5">

          <p><span class="text-dark font-medium">1. Browsing.</span> With just the router working in a low-signal area,
            every page loaded for what seemed like forever. Videos online kept buffering, and no matter how many times
            we refreshed the page, the result was the same. After plugging in <a href="#"
              class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a>, the speed massively improved,
            the videos, even long ones, loaded fine, emails sent in a blink of an eye.</p>
          <p><span class="text-dark font-medium">2. Video calls.</span> In a low-signal area with just the router
            running,
            trying to have a Zoom call was frustrating, to say the least. The video and sound hardly matched, the people
            on the other end kept disconnecting, their sentences got cut off. After plugging in Wi-Fi <a href="#"
              class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a>, the
            call went smoothly, with only minor defects that are more down to the platform than the internet.</p>
          <p><span class="text-dark font-medium">3. Gaming.</span> We loaded an online multi-player game to see how it
            goes. With the internet being unstable, it was impossible for us to communicate, reach our objectives, and
            properly enjoy the game. Some lag-switching was also noted, and that’s quite dangerous, for if someone were
            to report you for rubber-banding (as it looks to them), you’d get banned off the platform. Luckily,
            <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> solved this issue.</p>
          <p><span class="text-dark font-medium">4. Streaming.</span> - No matter how fast your internet is, streaming
            will become virtually impossible if it's unstable. But with Wi-Fi <a href="#"
              class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a>, our connection was way more
            stable, and we encountered no issues during our 2-hour stream.</p>
          <p class="mb-5">So, to summarize, not only has Xtraboost increased the range of our Wi-Fi signal, but it also
            improved
            its speed and stability, making everyday use of the internet far more enjoyable.</p>

          <h2>It’s stylish and compact</h2>
          <p>The first impression you might have upon receiving your Wi-Fi <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a>
            is that it’s way smaller than you
            imagined. Fitting in the palm of your hand, this gadget should not be underestimated. It will work
            surprisingly well wherever it’s placed. And the best thing about it? You can take it anywhere with you!
            You’re visiting relatives who have poor Wi-Fi signal? <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> will
            help you keep connected. Are you
            planning your holidays or <a href="#" class="font-medium">workcations</a>? <a href="#"
              class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> will massively improve
            weak hotel Wi-Fi. Safe and simple!
            It can be placed wherever there’s a power source in your home or office and won’t attract unwanted attention
            at all.</p>

          <img src="img/temp/Main3.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 my-5">

          <h2>It's effortless to set up</h2>
          <p>In just three simple steps, your Wi-Fi <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> can significantly
            improve your home or office
            connectivity, just like it did to us. There is no assembly needed – you can use it straight out of the box.
            The checkout process is straightforward, all we had to do was select the power plug we needed, enter our
            shipping details, pay, and that’s it. Then, when it arrived, it was just as easy.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>We took our <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> out of the box and plugged it into the
              electrical outlet located in-between the
              router and the total signal ‘dead’ zone.</li>
            <li>Using the WPS function, we linked the <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> to our router for
              a safe connection.</li>
            <li>The speed improved instantly! And the ‘dead’ zone? Now fully covered.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="mb-5">We deliberately ran our speed tests several times before and after plugging it in to check
            both consistency and improvement scale, and each time it did not disappoint. Both upload and download
            speeds were significantly boosted, and the ping was within the norm. The range also greatly increased.
            Hence, Wi-Fi <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> earned our seal of approval!</p>

          <h2>Finally, it has excellent value for money</h2>
          <p>We carefully selected all of our boosters to be reasonably affordable. Still, Wi-Fi <a href="#"
              class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> takes it even
            further, offering a great first-purchase discount and free shipping – something that other boosters on our
            list of elsewhere don’t. Since shipping tends to be almost as expensive as the item itself, <a href="#"
              class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a> is
            truly a bargain not to miss.</p>
          <p class="mb-5">It has all the features you would want from an excellent Wi-Fi booster without any of the
            drawbacks. And
            the performance it offers is truly praise-worthy. A single <a href="#" class="font-medium">Xtraboost</a>
            could be enough to eliminate any
            connectivity issues in your house or office. We are located in an old building, so trying to get a signal
            through those thick walls is a struggle. We believe in boosters because they eliminate the need to
            purchase pricier data plans or extra routers. One small device plugged into any power socket will solve
            the issues you had for good. And what’s not to love about that?</p>

                      <p>My parent’s house is really old, so, unfortunately, the Wi-Fi signal from the downstairs router
                        can’t reach the bedrooms upstairs. My parents were willing to sign up for a pricier data plan
                        with their ISP or even buy a new router, but I knew that this wouldn’t be cost-efficient. My
                        friend suggested getting a Wi-Fi booster, and I went with the most affordable Xtraboost. I’m
                        very happy that I did because now we can enjoy great Wi-Fi in any part of our home, with no
