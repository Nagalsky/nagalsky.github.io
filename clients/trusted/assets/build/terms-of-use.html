                <h4>16. Term and Termination
                </h4>
                <p>You and Company are independent contractors. Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint
                    venture, agency, or
                    employment relationship between you and Company. You must not under any circumstances make, or

                    warranties, representations, commitments or obligations on behalf of Company.</p>

                <h4>17. Assignment</h4>
                <p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by
                    you but may be assigned by Company without restriction or notification to you.</p>

                <h4>18. General</h4>
                <p>Company reserves the right to discontinue or modify any aspect of the Site at any time. These
                    Terms and the relationship between you and Company shall be governed by and construed in
                    accordance with the laws of the Republic of Lithuania, without regard to its principles of
                    conflict of laws. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the
                    courts located in Vilnius and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum
                    objections to such courts, provided that Company may seek injunctive relief in any court of
                    competent jurisdiction. These Terms shall constitute the entire agreement between you and
                    Company concerning the Site. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of
                    competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of
                    the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. No
                    waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such
                    term or any other term, and a party's failure to assert any right or provision under these
                    Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF
                    ACTION THAT YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1)
                    YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY
                    BARRED.</p>
