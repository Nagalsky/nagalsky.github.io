              <p>
                In general, the third-party providers used by us will only
                collect, use and disclose your information to the extent

                However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment
                gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their
                own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
                required to provide to them for your purchase-related
                transactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy
                policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal
                information will be handled by these providers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in
                or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction
                than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a
                transaction that involves the services of a third-party service
                provider, then your information may become subject to the laws
                of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its
                facilities are located.
