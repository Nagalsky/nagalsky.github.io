                  That Moment When You're Not Sure If You Should Drive
                </h2>
                <p>
                  We've all been there. You've had a couple at the pub after
                  work. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner. Or those "just one
                  more" drinks at your mate's birthday.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now you're standing by your car, keys in hand, doing that
                  mental maths we all hate. Was it two pints or three? How long
                  ago was that last one? Should you risk it or fork out £30 for
                  a taxi?
                </p>
                <img src="img/banner-2.jpg" alt="illustration" class="banner" />
                <p>
                  The worst part? That nagging doubt never really goes away.
                  Even when you've been careful. Even when you've counted every
                  drink. Even when you've waited ages. You're still playing a
                  guessing game with your future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And let's be honest – nobody wants to be that person who
                  leaves their car at the pub and has to retrieve it the next
                  morning. The hassle. The embarrassment. The extra costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What if you could know for certain? Right there, in seconds?
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="space-y-4">
                <h2 class="title">That's where AlcoGate comes in.</h2>
                <p>
                  It's a
                  <span class="font-bold"
                    >professional-standard breathalyser that fits in your
                    pocket</span
                  >
                  – and it's fast becoming essential kit for responsible drivers
                  across the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Think of it as having a
                  <span class="font-bold">police-grade alcohol tester</span> at
                  your fingertips. Because that's exactly what it is. The same
                  semiconductor sensor technology they use at the roadside,
                  shrunk down to the size of a mobile phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="font-bold"
                    >No more mental maths. No more "I think I'm fine." No more
                    expensive taxi rides</span
                  >
                  when you probably didn't need one. Just blow into it for three
                  seconds and you'll know exactly where you stand.
                </p>
                <img src="img/banner-3.jpg" alt="illustration" class="banner" />
                <p>
                  At just 7cm long, it slips into your glove box, jacket pocket,
                  or handbag without taking up any real space.
                  <span class="font-bold"
                    >So it's always there when that moment of doubt hits.</span
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  The best part? It gives you the
                  <span class="font-bold">exact same BAC reading</span> a police
                  breathalyser would. Down to the decimal point.
                  <span class="font-bold">In seconds.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thousands of UK drivers are already carrying one. Not because
                  they're heavy drinkers – quite the opposite. They're the ones
                  who want to be
                  <span class="font-bold">absolutely certain</span> they're
                  making the right choice – every single time.
                </p>

              <div class="space-y-4">
                <h2 class="title">Simple To Use (Even After A Few)</h2>
                <p>
                  Using AlcoGate couldn't be easier. Honestly, if you can check
                  your phone, you can use this.
                </p>

                  <li>
                    Press the power button. The LCD screen lights up and counts
                    down from 10 while it warms up. (This bit is important –
                    it's calibrating the sensor for accuracy.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When it beeps, blow steadily into the mouthpiece for about 3
                    seconds. Just like blowing out birthday candles, but
                    gentler.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your exact BAC level appears on the screen instantly. Clear
                    as day. No squinting at confusing colours or symbols – just
                    numbers you can't misread.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  The whole thing takes
                  <span class="font-bold">less than 15 seconds</span> from start
                  to finish. Quicker than googling "how long does alcohol stay
                  in your system" for the hundredth time.

                <p>
                  Summer's here. BBQs, beer gardens, long evenings with friends.
                  More reasons to drink – and more chances to make a costly
                  mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For £30, you
                  <span class="font-bold"
                    >never have to wonder "Am I okay to drive?" again.</span
                  >
                  No more anxious journeys home. No more leaving your car behind
                  unnecessarily. No more mental maths that might be wrong.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Be the mate everyone respects. The one who checks before
                  getting behind the wheel. The one who
                  <span class="font-bold">knows for certain</span> they're safe
                  to drive their friends home.

                  One small device.
                  <span class="font-bold">Total peace of mind.</span> Cheaper
                  than a single taxi ride, but
