                <p>Winter came fast this year.</p>
                <p>Every morning, I’d drag myself out of bed and shiver through the house, piling on sweaters and
                  blankets just to get warm. </p>
                <p>The idea of turning up the heat was tempting <span class="font-bold">– until I thought about what it
                    would do to my bills.</span> 🙅‍♀️</p>
                <p>News outlets say heating costs will be up at least 11% this winter. We all know what it really means…
                  I wouldn’t be surprised if <span class="font-bold">we paid 20% or even 30% more.</span> With heating
                  making up nearly a third of most people’s energy bills, <span class="font-bold">the numbers stack up
                    FAST.</span></p>

                <p>Especially if you live in the northern parts of the world, turning up the thermostat can literally be
                  like tossing money out the window.</p>
                <p class='font-bold'>And honestly, I don’t have any money left to toss away.</p>
                <p>So, I needed something better – something that could <span class="font-bold">heat up the space I was
                    actually using</span> without making me dread the end of the month when I see the bills.</p>

                <p>So I started asking around – seeing what friends and family were doing to avoid the <span
                    class="font-bold">UNREASONABLE bills</span> in exchange for a little heat.</p>
                <p>My sister, who lives up north (like Norway-type-of-north), swore by this tiny portable heater she
                  found.</p>

                    me warm during the day,” she told me. Honestly, I was skeptical. 🧐</p>
                </div>
                <p>Who wouldn’t be?! We’re talking about relying on a small heater to keep up with the kind of cold we
                  were getting.</p>
                <p class='font-bold'>But since it was my sister and not some random strangers on the internet, I decided
                  to give it a go.</p>
                <p>Worst case, I’ll have to add another useless gadget to the closet and will remind my sister about her
                  poor advice-giving skills for the rest of her life.</p>
                <p>The little heat machine in question was <span class="font-bold text-brand-500">HeaterLux</span>.</p>

                <p>When it arrived, I plugged it in, and boom, the heat just filled the room. No waiting, no layering

                <p class='font-bold'>😱 Is this how people in the south feel???</p>
                <p>After that initial run, HeaterLux became my go-to for any room. My home office? Warmed up in minutes.

                <p>This was my main doubt. What if I spend less on heating but spend more on electricity?</p>
                <p>I started digging and what I found pleasantly surprised me.</p>
                <img src="img/banner-5.jpg" alt="banner">
                <p>Turns out, for a portable heater like <span class="font-bold text-brand-500">HeaterLux</span>, the
                  savings can be pretty significant. But they depend on how it’s used.</p>
                <p>Here’s a <span class="font-bold">realistic breakdown</span> of what you can expect:</p>
                <div>
                  <p class='font-bold text-green-500 uppercase text-xl md:text-[24px] mb-1'>✅ TARGETED ROOM HEATING
                  </p>
                  <p>By using HeaterLux to heat only the spaces you’re actively using, you don’t have to heat unused
                    rooms. This “zone heating” approach reduces central heating usage, often leading to 20-40% savings
                    on your heating bill.</p>
                </div>

                  <p class='font-bold text-green-500 uppercase text-xl md:text-[24px] mb-1'>✅ LOW ENERGY CONSUMPTION
                  </p>
                  <p>HeaterLux uses less power than traditional space heaters or central heating. For every hour it’s
                    used instead of central heating, <span class="font-bold">you could be cutting costs by a few dollars
                      a day,</span> especially during peak heating hours. Over a month, this can add up, leading to an
                    estimated $50-$100 reduction in monthly heating costs.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Using HeaterLux as a supplement to central heating in colder rooms or during early mornings and
                    late evenings (instead of running the central heating all day) can add savings of <span

                      lifesaver. I use it in my home office during the day and move it to my bedroom at night. It heats
                      up fast, and I love that I can set the exact temperature. The tip-over shutoff is a huge plus
                      since I have two cats who knock everything over. My energy bill is noticeably lower, and I’m
                      actually warm for once!”

                <img src="img/banner-11.jpg" alt="banner">
                <p>The thermostat lets you set the temperature you want and with HeaterLux’s fan-assisted airflow, the
