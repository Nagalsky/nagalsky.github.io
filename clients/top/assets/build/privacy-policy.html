                <h4>Section 4 - Payment</h4>
                <p>All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
                    Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                    Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our
                    Site and its service providers.</p>

                <h4>Section 5 - Third-party services</h4>
                <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your

                <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
                    transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
                    required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>

                    located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a
                    transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information
                    may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its
                    facilities are located.</p>
