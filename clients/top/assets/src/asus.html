                    <p>Another excellent choice for improving internet connection is <span class="font-medium">ASUS
                            RP-AC55</span>. This dual-band
                        repeater delivers <span class="font-medium">up to 1200Mbps speed</span>. It is powered by the
                        new
                        <span class="font-medium">802.11ac chipset</span>, providing a
                        super-fast Wireless-AC internet connection – about 3 times faster than standard Wireless-N.
                        Hence, with ASUS RP-AC55, ultra-fast and smooth streaming, downloading and browsing. What’s cool
                        about this WiFi extender is that it functions in any building or house. So, <span
                            class="font-medium">forget about ‘dead
                            zones’</span> – they will be quickly sorted. However, to achieve the best ASUS performance,
                        this
                        internet extender should be placed between the existing router and the area where it needs a
                        better connection than others. And there’s more! ASUS RP-AC55 maintains <span
                            class="font-medium">3-in-1 modes</span>, meaning
                        that it can be on a repeater mode, act as an access point (AP), or act as a media bridge.</p>

                        have to worry about whether your route will be compatible with this WiFi extender. Moreover,
                        ASUS RP-AC55 comes with an <span class="font-medium">AiMesh feature</span> that connects
                        multiple ASUS
                        routers to create a 'whole
                        home' network. Hence, if you have a couple of ASUS devices, this feature would be pretty useful.
                        Plus, the AiMesh feature includes <span class="font-medium">AirProtection, Adaptive QoS, and
                            Parental Controls</span> for your

                        antennas for more effective performance.</p>
