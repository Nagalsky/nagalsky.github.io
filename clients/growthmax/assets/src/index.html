      <h4 class="text-black">The price of electricity is quickly increasing each year, a new controversial
        Nikola-Tesla-inspired
        technology, sets to change that. Consumers across the US are saving hundreds to thousands of dollars every year
        on their power bills!</h4>
      <p>Just this year, a new study suggested that most Americans are overpaying for electricity by a whopping $27.6
        billion dollars per year.</p>
      <p>It's very apparent that we as Americans have an energy crisis—a lack of energy from lawmakers and the Public
        Utility Commission about fixing the crooked business of selling overpriced electricity to consumers.</p>
      <p>Both sides are giving each other cover to do nothing. Just this year, the Public Utility Commission sent
        lawmakers a report about the glorious, incredible, fantastic electricity shopping system it regulates. A
        problem? Not on their watch.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers who get that report from the state regulators can say, <i>"Everything is fine. We don't need to
          make
          changes."</i></p>
      <p>Lawmakers refuse to introduce an electricity bill that is designed to end the deceptive marketing practices
        that power companies use to reap massive profits every year.</p>

      <a href="#" class="content-img my-4">

      <p>The system remains a horror show of confusion, duplicity, and unnecessary complications. There's no reason why
        electricity companies should get the better of regulators and consumers, but they do it time and again.</p>
      <p>If you look at descriptions of more than 300 electricity plans from 55 companies, you see a jumble of garbage
        language, terms, conditions, and small print—your eyes bulge.</p>
      <p><b>Why does this matter? This duplicity leads to you paying more.
        </b></p>
      <p>Electricity companies also confuse shoppers with tiered pricing—different rates for different usage
        levels—but they make sure that the lowest prices to show up early in search results.</p>
      <p>So, to cut a long story short, Big Energy is running a massive racket, and as long as they are not regulated,
        they'll continue to get away with it.</p>
      <p>But the war isn't lost for the ordinary consumer. Thankfully, clever new technology can help average
        consumers <a href="#" class="underline">reduce their electric bills by up to 90% a month after the first month
          >>></a></p>

      <p>A California-based startup has come up with a new innovative and inexpensive gadget that helps you not only
        lower your electric bill, but can also increase the lifespan on expensive household appliances. Within just one
        month, the device would pay for itself.</p>
      <h3>What is This Device?</h3>
      <p>It's called the PowerVolt and its tech was originally created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American
        inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, Nikola Tesla.</p>
      <p>nitially it was concealed from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save
        on their monthly energy costs. <a href="#" class="underline">The PowerVolt is a small, compact, affordable,
          and easy-to-use plug-in unit</a>
        that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
      <p>The PowerVolt is your power company's worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide The PowerVolt from the
        everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
      <p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
      <p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less
        power consumption overall, as well as that used by household appliances.</p>

      <a href="#" class="content-img my-4">
        <img src="img/temp/MMD.jpg" alt="" class="w-100">
      </a>

      <p>The bonus? Your standard blender, microwave, vacuum, or any other household appliance may last longer.</p>
      <p>In essence, the PowerVolt provides the opportunity for you to <a href="#" class="underline">save up to 90% on
          your energy bill</a>. That's a
        phenomenal savings and makes it easy to understand why Big Energy wants this device hidden from consumers for
        good.</p>
      <p>The benefits of the PowerVolt are unparalleled, and researchers are convinced this device could spell the end
        of unaffordable power bills that can cripple the average wage-earner at the end of the month.</p>
      <p>Scientists initially spent many months trying to debunk claims of efficacy, but those studies now prove that
        <a href="#" class="underline">the PowerVolt should be commonplace in every household</a>.</p>
      <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
      <p>It's easy to connect, simply plug into the outlet closest to your breaker box. That is all you need to do,
        once plugged in the green LED indicates it is powered on and working.</p>

      <a href="#" class="content-img my-4">
        <img src="img/temp/dmksa.jpg" alt="" class="w-100">
      </a>

      <p>If your home is large it is beneficial to place 1 unit close to the breaker box and another as far away
        from it as possible. It is as simple as that. and it's suitable for both standard homes and apartments
        connected to an electrical grid. One can hardly say this is a "baseless" claim, and pure reason has many
        people suspicious.</p>
      <p>Once you've plugged it in, the PowerVolt will get to work. Within a few days, it will begin to make
        efficient use of your energy while allowing you to reap the rewards of a more robust household appliance
        life-cycle. <b>In just a short time, you will have made your money back on your initial purchase.</b></p>
      <p>Appliances always draw more power than they need to run due to inefficiencies and noise on the sine wave.
      </p>

      <a href="#" class="content-img my-4">
        <img src="img/temp/ms.jpg" alt="" class="w-100">
      </a>

      <p>The PowerVolt reduces this noise therefore decreases the amount of electricity wasted. It does not change what
        the meter reads or steal extra power from anywhere, it just uses the energy more efficiently therefore needing
        less of it.</p>
      <h3>Can Energy Companies Stop This?</h3>
      <p>Now that you know the first truth—that power companies massively overcharge their customers—you should also
        know the second truth (one that almost no one is aware of): your utility company's power is overloading
        circuits and shortening the lifespans of your <a href="#" class="underline">expensive household appliances in
          the process</a>.</p>
      <p>So, you're set to lose more than just money from your wallet. When the PowerVolt was discovered overseas,
        power companies then spent millions <b>(likely your money from years of overpaying)</b> to stop the
        product from
        reaching retail store shelves.</p>

      <a href="#" class="content-img my-4">
        <img src="img/temp/_d.jpg" alt="" class="w-100">
      </a>

      <p>It would spell the end of their profiteering, so it was important that they kept it out of the public eye.</p>
      <p>However, the questionable legality of such a move put a stop to this, and now close to 150,000 households
        worldwide are experiencing lower power bills, <a href="#" class="underline">all because of an inconspicuous
          plug-in device</a>.</p>
      <h3>Is This Device Actually Legal?</h3>
      <p><a href="#" class="underline">The PowerVolt</a> is absolutely 100% legal; you're at no legal risk for
        owning this excellent
        electricity-saving device because simply put, you're not breaking any laws.</p>
      <p>Of course, power companies are not happy with the situation, so they are trying their best to hide the
        PowerVolt from the public eye.</p>
      <h3>How Much is it Going To Cost Me?</h3>
      <p>You're probably thinking, given what this tech can do, it probably has to cost a fortune. False! The
        PowerVolt is on sale at the moment and the more you buy, the more you save!</p>
      <p>Make sure you get yours while you can, due to recent media attention and mounting pressure from Big
        Energy, these handy little gadgets may become impossible to find in the near future.</p>
