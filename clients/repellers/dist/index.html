                  Wouldn’t it be nice if you never had to set another mouse trap in your house? Thanks to this brand new
                  device, millions
                  of Americans never have to worry about seeing another rodent in their house again..

            <div class="space-y-7">
              <p>Every home in the United States has had a pest problem. We all want them to go away, whether it’s
                creepy crawlers
                creeping around, an ant infestation, or rodents getting into our storage room.</p>
              <p>So far we’ve tried several ways of getting rid of these pests with no luck. Most of us will get chills
                from grabbing a
                tissue and squishing that icky bug. Spraying a bottle of Raid all over the home is hazardous to our
                health. And if you
                love animals, you might not want to set a trap to harm that poor little mouse.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, there is a revolutionary new method of dealing with these pests, both insects and rodents,
                that does not
                involve killing them and is completely safe for your health.</p>

              <h2 class="title">What Is It?</h2>
              <p>It’s called <span class="font-bold">Pest Defence</span>, and it’s swiftly becoming a must-have
                household item for every American.</p>
              <img src="img/banner-2.jpg" alt="banner-2" class="w-full">
              <p>The company behind <span class="font-bold">Pest Defence</span> was formed in 2019 by a group of
                experienced engineers from the EV (Electric vehicle)
                industry.</p>
              <p>Their goal was to design an effective device to help homeowners keep annoying pests and critters away
                from their homes.</p>
              <p>With no installation costs, no maintenance costs and it being more effective than the alternatives, <a
                  href="#" class="font-bold text-green-500 underline">The Pest Defence is
                  an engineering masterpiece.</a></p>
              <p>When compared to other pest repellents on the market, <span class="font-bold">it is 300 percent more
                  efficient, useful, inconspicuous, and cost
                  effective—and it immediately begins working to keep pests out of your home!</span></p>
              <p>People all over the US are using it to <span class="font-bold">live ‘pest free’</span> — the results
                are incredible…</p>
            </div>

            <div class="space-y-7">
              <h2 class="title">How Does It Work?</h2>
              <img src="img/banner-3.jpg" alt="banner-3" class="w-full">
              <p>This discreet device uses <span class="font-bold">state-of-the-art bionic, electromagnetic, and
                  ultrasonic wave technology</span> that humans and pets
                cannot hear to create an uncomfortable, but non-lethal environment for rodents, cockroaches, mosquitoes,
                ants, and other
                common unwanted insect and animal visitors. This means they’ll keep their distance, and you won’t be
                left with any
                unnecessary clean up.</p>
              <p>Simply plug the the <a href="#" class="font-bold text-green-500 hover:underline">Pest Defence</a> unit
                into any outlet and in no time at all your home will be completely free of
                unwanted household pests. The process to completely remove all pests in your home takes about 3 weeks.

                Usually they can
                work in one room but won’t cover a complete house. The device’s frequency gets weaker as it spreads
                further. Therefore,
                depending on the areas where pests may be present, you may need several units for multiple areas in your
