                        <p>Well, as you may remember, the reason tinnitus was able to take hold in your body is because
                            your ear-to-brain wire was thinning, almost to the point where it snaps entirely.</p>
                        <p>And as you’ve seen for yourself…</p>
                        <p>Without strengthening this ear-to-brain wire…</p>
                        <p>The damage that happens to your body becomes permanent…</p>
                        <p>And nowhere is it more devastating than in your ears, as it starts to degenerate entirely.

                            VitaHear Plus provides.</p>
                        <p>Why would this matter if your hearing has recovered?</p>
                        <p>Because, as you well know, a lot of the damage to your ears was caused by the stresses
                            of modern life.</p>
                        <p>Chemicals in the environment…</p>
                        <p>Loud music or noises…</p>

                        <p>And invisible viruses and bacteria.</p>
                        <p>So even if VitaHear Plus’s powerful nutrients boost you right back to perfect hearing…

                        <p>That damage is still going to keep happening to your ears..</p>
                        <p>And if your ear-to-brain wire is days away from snapping…</p>
                        <p>Then it’s only a matter of time until the whooshing, ringing, and buzzing noise in your
                            ears start coming back…</p>
                        <p>Leaving you trapped in the house again because its too unsafe to leave…</p>
                        <p>Frustrated you can’t do the things you love, whether it’s listening to music, watching

                        <p>Sharon Eric, from Albany, New York, wrote me to say…</p>
                        <p><i>“After the first week, I noticed some positive results. Well it’s now been more than 5
                                months since I ordered VitaHear Plus, and I can honestly say that my hearing is 90% back
                                to where it was. I’m glad I ordered more while I could, because this way I know my ears
                                are safe all year round.”</i></p>
                        <p>Then there’s Victoria Collier from Denver, Colorado who told us…</p>
                        <p><i>“I started experiencing ringing ears about a year ago. The thought of living the rest of
                                my life like this made me sick, so I’d resigned myself to slowly going deafd and not
                                being able to take care of myself. But after discovering VitaHear Plus I’ve literally
                                seen how life-changing the results are.”</i></p>
                        <p>And there’s literally hundreds of more of those!</p>
