          The more specific the idea you have of what you want to see, the more
          relevant words you’ll need to type to produce it.
        </li>
        <li>
          When talking to the AI, a useful tip is to have a subject and several
          words next to specify the style which you desire.
        </li>
        <li>
          The style can be the names of the artists you want to take inspiration
          from, the name of the artistic movement, the name of the style, the
          perspective from where the image is seen, geographical areas,
          historical periods, or even words such as “8k” and “award-winning” to
          tell the AI you want something great looking!
        </li>
        <li>
          Experiment with punctuation: use commas, +, dots, semicolons, and
          more. Nobody knows what’s the right punctuation!
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice and Trial and Error make you perfect. The more you talk to
          the AI, the more you will understand how to talk to it.
