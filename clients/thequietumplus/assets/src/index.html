          <h2 class="text-center mb-5">The Simple Way To Support Your Hearing Health</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Patrick Bark, and I’ve been a long time researcher passionate to help people
            all over the
            world on how to live better and spread awareness on how anyone can help support their healthy hearing.</p>
          <p>You see, according to the <u>World Health Organisation</u> 50% of hearing loss and impairment
            is avoidable
            with early detection, prevention and management</p>
          <p>While the field of audiology has seen impressive advances in hearing aid technology, I
            discovered that
            there
            are several easy, natural things anyone can do on their own that may help support their healthy hearing.</p>
          <p>So please, listen up to the following recommendations: </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box--card lead">
          <p><b>1. Know how the ear works</b></p>
          <p>The first step in healthy hearing is awareness. </p>
          <p>The ear is a complex organ that can be easily damaged so it is incredibly useful to understand how it
            responds to different situations to prevent potential harm. </p>
          <p>Even a basic overview of the ear should give a good idea of what’s going on when you hear sound and what’s
            happening to the ear when it’s exposed to loud noise. </p>
          <p>There are lots of good sources of easy to understand explanations of how the different parts of the ear
            work and how they work together in the system to allow a person to hear.</p>
          <p class="py-3"><b>2. Get some exercise (No gym required)</b></p>
          <p>Your ears detect sounds, but it's your brain that interprets them. </p>
          <p>Exercises that strengthen your brain's hearing comprehension skills might help make you a better listener.
          </p>
          <p>Here are two activities you can try:</p>
          <p>The first one is to go for a walk in the woods, on the beach or in a similar setting with little man-made
            noise.</p>
          <p>Focus on your surroundings and write down everything you hear, from birds chirping to the wind blowing.
          </p>
          <p>Repeat this exercise several days in a row to gradually become more attuned to the ambient noise.</p>
          <p>The second activity is even more fun: </p>
          <p>Have a partner read aloud to you from a book or magazine on an unfamiliar topic. </p>
          <p>After each sentence, try to repeat exactly what your partner said. </p>
          <p>Once you're able to consistently repeat the sentences word-for-word, try the exercise again with the TV on
            in the background or in a noisy restaurant.</p>
          <p class="py-3"><b>3. Don’t stick things in your ear</b></p>
          <p>Also known as cerumen, ear wax is a natural defense mechanism that protects the inside of your ear from
            foreign particles, bacteria and infection. </p>
          <p>It is secreted by special glands located in your outer ear, and varies in color and consistency from person
            to person.</p>
          <p>The ear is sensitive and the ear drum in particular is delicate. </p>
          <p>The old saying ‘don’t put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear’ is a good rule of thumb here. </p>
          <p>By using Q-tips or cotton buds or any small objects to clean or scratch the ear you are at a higher risk of
            perforating the eardrum. </p>
          <p>This is painful and can leave lasting damage to your hearing..</p>
          <p class="py-3"><b>4. Be aware of volume on personal music players</b></p>
          <p>It’s easier than ever to be surrounded by sound and music throughout the day but with that comes a
            potential opportunity for hearing damage. </p>
          <p>The latest versions of MP3 players and iPods have a volume limit built in, enabling this feature prevents
            the device from going above noise levels that would be deemed dangerous. </p>
          <p>As a general rule of thumb, if the people around you can hear the music you’re playing through your device,
            it’s too loud. </p>
          <p>The volume level should be just a little above audible, but be aware of particularly noisy environments
            where the background noise is so great that even this moderate measurement produces music that is too loud.
          </p>
          <p>Your choice of headphones will also have an impact on the levels of sound your ears can withstand before
            they’re at risk of being damaged.</p>
          <p class="py-3"><b>5. Get regular check ups</b></p>
          <p>An important part of looking after your hearing is to get it regularly checked out by a medical
            professional. Having periodic check ups allows your doctors to track or spot any changes that may have
            occurred early on and so appropriate action can be taken. Audiograms give a measure of hearing sensitivity
            at a range of frequencies and tracking audiograms over a period of time may be particularly useful if you
            work in a noisy environment so any damage can be detected.</p>
          <p>My life-time vision is that of a world where everybody can easily and affordably support the natural health
            of their hearing.</p>
          <p>That’s why I’ve spent most of my research activity trying and testing various ways that could really make a
            positive impact on people’s lives. </p>
          <p>Based on this research, I’ve searched for a natural, inexpensive mix of vitamins, plants and herbs that,
            combined with the tips above, could help anyone support their healthy hearing. </p>
          <p>And after many trials, I’ve perfected a simple, yet powerful formula, consisting of Yam, Fenugreek, Dong
            Quai , L-Tyrosine, Motherwort, Black Cohosh Oat Grass, Pacific Kelp, Blessed Thistle and Hops Extract.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box lead">
          <p>I couldn’t keep this all to myself...</p>
          <p>So, together with the help of some friends who own a small supplement company, I’ve decided to produce it
            and make it available for everybody:</p>
          <h3 class="py-3 text-center"><b>We called it “Quietum Plus”</b></h3>
          <div class="py-lg-3"></div>
          <p>Given all these powerful ingredients, I initially wanted to set the value for <b>Quietum Plus</b> at $99 a
            bottle.</p>
          <p>And, if you see this from our point of view, I’m sure you can understand why.</p>
          <p>All the ingredients used are natural, some of them quite rare and hard to obtain...</p>
          <p>Also, add on the costs of seeing a specialist in your area, including the diagnoses he’ll make you pay for
            and the drugs he is going to prescribe to you…</p>
          <p><b>Well, given all of this, $99 a bottle should seem like a TOTAL STEAL.</b></p>
          <p>But like I mentioned already, <b>Quietum Plus</b> is not about us making a profit.</p>
          <p>Which is why there’s no chance I could consider charging you $99 for this.</p>
          <p><b>And because you’re watching this presentation, you will benefit from a discount from our awareness
              campaign...</b></p>
          <p>If you act today, through this website... and make the life changing decision of investing in this
            extraordinary natural weapon, you can have it for yourself…</p>
          <h4 class="py-3"><b>For only $69 a bottle.</b></h4>
          <p><b>But you know what?</b></p>
          <p>I'm going to make the deal even sweeter. </p>
          <p>Because I know how hard it is to live paralyzed by that hellish sound day after day, and night after night…
          </p>
          <p><b>I've set up a discounted package system of 6 bottles of Quietum Plus for you, for only $49 dollars a
              bottle, for a total of $294 which is being offered TODAY ONLY... for as long as supplies last. You also
              get free shipping on us.</b></p>
          <p><b>Once we run out of bottles, the "BUY NOW" buttons will not be active anymore until we make another batch
              again (which takes around 2-3 months at least).</b></p>
          <p><b>Click the 6-bottle package (or any other package that you want) below to secure your order.</b></p>
          <p><b>Consider this the smallest, but most powerful investment that you have ever made for yourself!</b></p>
          <p><b>You may be saying, “OK, this sounds amazing and I'm interested! How do I get started?”</b></p>
          <p>Click the yellow button below after choosing the best package for you, and you'll end up on our secure
            checkout page. Enter your payment details, place the order... and in 7 days from this moment, you'll get
            <b>Quietum Plus</b> delivered to your home!</p>
          <p>BUT CLICK NOW, IT’S THE ONLY WAY SECURE YOUR PACKAGE WHILE SUPPLIES LAST!</p>
