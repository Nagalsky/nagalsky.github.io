              <p>With more of our readers working from home it's clear that the demand is higher than ever for WiFi
                Boosters. Most home
                WiFi routers struggle to reach far bedrooms, offices, or outdoors with a usable, stable signal. There
                are some options
                on the business market that are great, but they require extensive supporting hardware, setup knowledge
                and are
                expensive. Enter WiFi Xtraboost. This new company has figured out a way to offer a far superior product
                (even the
                biggest networking experts agree) at a fraction of the price with their limited time 50% off discount.
              </p>
              <p>The price was so low, we were skeptical that it could deliver on the performance, but we were wrong.
                Now with positive
                user feedback rolling in their new <a href="#" class='text-brand-500'>WiFi Xtraboost</a> is quickly
                becoming the most successful device of 2025. We knew it was
                time to put in to the test against the best of the best.</p>
              <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">Here is what we found.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="space-y-7">
              <h2 class="title">Plug & Play Setup</h2>
              <img src="img/banner-2.jpg" alt="banner-2" class="w-full">
              <p>WiFi Xtraboost was created by a group of networking engineers that hated hard to use, overly
                complicated WiFi extenders.
                They claim anyone can setup WiFi Xtraboost in less than 5 minutes and we have to admit – <span
                  class="font-bold">setup couldn’t have been
                  easier</span>.</p>
              <p>We always order it ourselves to ensure we get the same experience as any customer would. It arrived 3
                days later and
                when we opened the box – we were surprised by how small this thing is. You can easily plug it into any
                wall socket,
                making it sit flat against the wall.</p>
              <p>Designed to be used without any technical knowledge whatsoever, you press a single button on the
                booster to pair it with
                your router. Seconds later, it found and connected to our WiFi – in a total of only 57 seconds, it was
                ready to use. It
                was time to test what mattered most, WiFi improvement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="space-y-7">
              <h2 class="title">Complete WiFi Coverage</h2>
              <img src="img/banner-3.jpg" alt="banner-2" class="w-full">
              <p>The issue with most WiFi systems, is you have a single router in one part of your house. Then you are
                sending the WiFi
                signal through walls, appliances, floors, ceilings, etc. If you even get a signal at the farthest point,
                it may not only
                be slow, but unreliable (dropped calls, stuttering video, etc). Each wall can drop the speed by 1/2 or
                more.</p>
              <p>For this torture test, I placed the router on the farthest side of my house which is my living room and
                measured the
                signal through the rest of the house. Before WiFi Xtraboost, the living room with the router had 5 bars
                of signal, the
                master bedroom 3 bars of signal, the basement 2 bars and the outdoor area was 1 bar. Even when it was
                usable it was
                still slow.</p>
              <p>Next, I placed the WiFi Xtraboost in the master bedroom which is located in the middle of the house.
                You want enough
                signal at the booster so it can extend your WiFi at top speeds. Remarkably, we saw an instant huge boost
                in range and
                speed.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>All the rooms on the first floor now have 5 bars of WiFi. The speed at the farthest part of the house
                  doubled. Even with
                  my concrete walls (which are the hardest) the booster was able to break through.</p>

                  5 Bar WiFi Across 3 Floors (even the basement)
                </h4>
                <p>The one area I thought was going to be minimal was the basement. Not only did WiFi Xtraboost deliver
                  5 full bars of WiFi
                  to every room on the first floor, we measured 5 bars in my basement which shares a wall with the
                  garage.
                </p>
                <p>I do have a small attic turned into a spare bedroom, when tested it also got 4 bars (from 1) but the
                  speed was more than
                  2x before. An excellent result and completely unexpected.</p>

                  4-5 Bar WiFi In Backyard & Garage
                </h4>
                <p>After I saw the improvement in the basement, I decided to see how far it could go. Walking out to the
                  farthest corner of
                  my fence, I was able to still get 4 bars of signal while the rest of the yard was 4-5 as well.</p>
                <p>Overall, this tiny device put out big performance improvements in connection reliability. I was able
                  to make video calls
                  easily walking around my house where before I would have to stay next to the router.</p>

              <p>Next up, we wanted to see exactly how much of an improvement WiFi Xtraboost would make. We ran multiple
                speed tests, in
                each location.
              </p>
              <p>During our tests, WiFi Xtraboost worked extremely well. Our speeds increased from 80% to an amazing
                579%! These are
                professional level speeds, in my home.</p>

              <p>Beyond the impressive speed improvements & complete coverage, the <span class="font-bold">100% solid

                calls drop, videos stop, downloads fail, with our old WiFi setup.</p>
              <p>Now with WiFi Xtraboost, it just would not stop working, no matter what we were doing, our internet was
                working. This is
                the BIGGEST improvement I can say when you decide to run a device as capable as WiFi Xtraboost.</p>

                  <p>‍Absolutely yes. The device, while powerful, is perfectly safe to use in your home or office. It's

              <h2 class="title">How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
              <p>Traditional WiFi extenders go for €100 - €350+ so you would expect the WiFi Xtraboost to be at least
                this... Normally,
                the WiFi Xtraboost retails for €99, which is a great deal compared to anything else you can buy on the
                market.</p>
              <p>However, right now they have a <span class="font-bold">massive 50% first-time buyer
                  discount</span> bringing the price down to just <span class="font-bold">€49</span>. That is by far
                the highest value we've ever tested for a device that will improve your internet speed & reliability. If
                you find it in
                stock, <span class="font-bold">it's a no brainer.</span></p>
